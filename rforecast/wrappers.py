  '''
  Constructs a forecast of a seasonal time series by seasonally decomposing 
  it using an STL decomposition, then making a non-seasonal forecast on the 
  seasonally adjusted data, and finally adding the naively extended seasonal 
  component on to the forecast.
  
  Args:
    x: an R time series, obtained from converters.ts(), or a Pandas Series
      with the correct index (e.g. from converters.sequence_as_series().
      For this forecast method, x should be seasonal.
    h : Forecast horizon; default is 2 full periods of a periodic series
    s.window : either 'periodic' or the span (in lags) of the 
      loess window for seasonal extraction, which should be odd.
    robust : If True, use robust fitting in the loess procedure.
    lam : BoxCox transformation parameter. The default is R's NULL value.
      If NULL, no transformation is applied. Otherwise, a Box-Cox 
      transformation is applied before forecasting and inverted after.
    method : One of 'ets' or 'arima'; default is 'ets'. Specifies the type 
      of model to use for forecasting the non-seasonal part.
    etsmodel : Default is 'ZZZ'. This is only used if 'method' is 'ets'.
      A 3-letter string denoting the ets model type.
      Letters denote error, trend, and seasonal parts: A=additive, 
      N=none, M=multiplicative, Z=automatically selected. Legal 
      values for first part are (A, M, Z), all values are legal 
      for other parts.
    xreg : Only available if 'method' is arima. An optional vector or matrix 
      of regressors, which must have one row/element for each point in x. 
      Default is NULL, for no regressors.
    newxreg : Only available if 'method' is arima. If regressors are used in 
      fitting, then they must be supplied for the forecast period as newxreg.
    level : A number or list/tuple of prediction interval confidence values.
      Default is 80% and 95% intervals.
