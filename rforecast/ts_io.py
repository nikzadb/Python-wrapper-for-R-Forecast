'''
ts_io.py handles reading time series into Pandas Series objects with the 
index set up as used in RForecast.

def read_series(file):
  '''
  Function read_ts reads a csv file of a time series. Input file should have 
  1, 2, or 3 columns. If 1 column, it is data-only. If 2-columns, it is read 
  as a non-seasonal timeseries like: time, data. If 3-column, it is read as a 
  seasonal time series, e.g. year, month, data. Seasonal time series will be 
  represented with a Series with a MultiIndex.
  
  Args:
    file: a path or open file to the data

    a Pandas Series with the data in the file, and the appropriate type of
